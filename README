NAME
      BFD - Impromptu dumping of data structures for debugging purposes

SYNOPSIS
       my $scary_structure1 = foo();
       my $scary_structure2 = bar();
       use BFD; d $scary_structure1, " hmmm ", $scary_structure2, ...;
       ....

DESCRIPTION
    Allows for impromptu dumping of output to STDERR. Useful when you want
    to take a peek at a nest Perl data structure by emitting (relatively)
    nicely formatted output.

    Basically,

        use BFD;d $foo;

    is shorthand for

        use Data::Dumper;
        local $Data::Dumper::Indent    = 1;
        local $Data::Dumper::Quotekeys = 0;
        local $Data::Dumper::Terse     = 1;
        local $Data::Dumper::Sortkeys  = 1;
        warn Dumper( $foo );

    I use this incantation soooo often that a TLA version is warranted.
    YMMV.

LIMITATIONS
    Uses Data::Dumper, which has varying degrees of stability and usefulness
    on different versions of perl.
